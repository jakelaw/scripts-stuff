Issues:
Minimal changes were made after completing the tutorial on socket.io.
This is not available on AWS, since I don't understand how to use it/am unable to install Node.js on a server.
There is no database of chat messages, since I couldn't figure out how to use MongoDB.

Additions:
Keeps track of the number of guests online.
Changeds a few colours to ones I prefer.
Otherwise no significant changes.

Notes:
I don't feel like I will wrap my mind around this project in time, so I am going to spend
a few hours of my weekend outside of my bedroom and away from my computer. Given more time to
understand JSavaScript I believe I would have been able to make more significant changes and implement 
proper backend suport.

If I were to do this again, I wouldn't have put any energy into the AWS aspect until the very end,
I wasted too many hours with that.
